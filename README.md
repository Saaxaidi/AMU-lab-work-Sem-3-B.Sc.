# Department Lab Work for BSc Computer Application

This repository contains lab work for the **BSc Computer Application** course, focusing on **Introduction to Java**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **Basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The lab is structured over a **14-week semester**, with weekly assignments designed to reinforce Java programming concepts, including:

- Core Java syntax and functionality
- Principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Implementation of basic Data Structures
- Algorithms for solving common computational problems

Each week, new assignments will be added to explore and practice different aspects of Java, providing hands-on experience with real-world applications of the language.
